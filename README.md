Rust implementation for high performance cache, like Caffeine in Java

In Egyptian mythology, the god most associated with memory and writing is Thoth. Thoth is often depicted as the god of wisdom, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgment, and the dead. He is also considered a scribe and the recorder of all things, which makes him particularly fitting for a system that involves memorability and data storage.

Given this, his item or pet would be a highly appropriate name for a cache system that aims to be reliable, efficient, and memorable. This name must encapsulates the essence of preserving and retrieving data effectively, just as Thoth is believed to have recorded and maintained the knowledge and memories of the gods and the universe.

**Baboons** are sacred to Thoth and were considered intelligent and wise creatures in ancient Egypt. This name suggests a clever and efficient caching system.
